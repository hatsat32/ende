## speckit.constitution

Focus on code quality, testing standards, user experience, consistency, and performance requirements. simple is better then complex. Explicit is better than implicit. Readability counts. code quality matters.

## speckit.specify

I want you to create a cli tool for encoding and decoding.

- enb64, deb64: encode and decode base64
- enb32, deb32: encode and decode base32
- enb16, deb16: encode and decode base16
- enhex, dehex: encode and decode hex
- enhtml, dehtml: encode and decode html
- enurl, deurl: encode and decode url
- enrot13, derot13: encode and decode rot13
- etc.

accept input from stdin and arguments. if no argument is provided, read from stdin. if arguments are provided, read from arguments.

follow linux phsophy. do one thing and do it well. do it in the most unix-like way.

## speckit.plan

use golang as programming language. use standard and modern project structure. use cobra to create cli library. prefer standart library over 3. parti libraries.
